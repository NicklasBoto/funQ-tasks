# Task 3 - Quantum Coin Flip

Use one of the quantum logic gates described in the README to create a function that returns 0 and 1 with 50/50 probability.

Your output should look something like this

```
$ funq solutions/task3.fq --runs=1024
0:      50.39%  516
1:      49.6%   508
```

Enter your solution [here](solutions/task3.fq).
